# Why?

My friend, Becca Williams gave a great talk on creating the YouTube summariser.

And then she issued a challenge to build on her starter code and extend the capabilities.

The code in this repo heavily leaned on Becca's starter code.

What I learned

* That GPT Vision is friendly and easy to use
* How easy it is to download videos from YouTube (for educational purposes only)

Do I use it?

I am one of those strange people that actually enjoys consuming content, making my own notes and integrating them into my second brain.

As a result, I don't use this summariser in my daily workflow.
